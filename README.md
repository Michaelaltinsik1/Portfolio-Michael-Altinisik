# Portfolio-Michael-Altinisik

I am a Frontend developer student at IT Högskolan. It’s a two year long education. Finishing my first year in may 2022, hence I am looking for an internship for autumn 2022. I am thorough, motivated and I always strive to evolve. I have always had a interest in IT, because  I have used computers since I was young. 

My programming interest came during my first programming course while I studied at KTH and my interest has only evolved since.
